# Citing the ITensor Library

Though there is currently no published paper officially associated 
with the ITensor Library, you can cite the software and the ITensor
website itself. 

In the text of your paper, or in your acknowledgements, we suggest
you write something like
`"Calculations were performed using the ITensor Library\cite{ITensor}."`

Then in your BibTeX file define the following citation:

    @article{ITensor,
    Journal = {\mbox{ITensor Library} (version 2.0.11) http://itensor.org},
    }

where you should replace the version number with the version you used.
