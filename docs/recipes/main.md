# Code Recipes #

Below we have collected 'recipes' for common tasks and code patterns 
that come up often when using the ITensor Library. Please send an email
to Miles Stoudenmire (emiles -at- pitp.ca) if you have an idea for a recipe you would
like to see.

## ITensor Recipes  ##
Recipes at the level of working with individual tensors and indices (objects like Index, ITensor).

* [[Create a set of Site indices to use as a lattice|recipes/index_sites]]
* [[Making a single-site operator (no quantum numbers)|recipes/itensor_single_site_op]]

## IQTensor Recipes  ##
Recipes at the level of working with individual quantum number tensors and indices (objects like IQIndex, IQTensor).

## MPS and DMRG Recipes ##
Recipes at the level of the MPS, IQMPS classes and the "dmrg" method

* [[Perform a basic DMRG calculation|recipes/basic_dmrg]]
* [[Measure the properties of an MPS wavefunction|recipes/measure_mps]]
