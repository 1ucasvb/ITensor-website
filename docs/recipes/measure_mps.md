#Measure the properties of an MPS wavefunction#

Consider trying to measure the z-component of some site `j`
in the Heisenberg chain.  Due to the ability of the MPS
wavefunction to locally represent the wavefunction, local operators
such as Sz

<math>\hat H = -J \sum_{j =1}^{N} \sigma_j \sigma_{j+1} - h \sum_{j =1}^{N} \sigma_j </math>
