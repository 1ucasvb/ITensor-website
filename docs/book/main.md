# ðŸ“š  The ITensor Book

ITensor simplifies tensor
calculations through an Einstein summation interface for contracting tensors.
Because each ITensor index has a distinct identity, nothing about the interface
depends on index order, making code easy to write and maintain.
Even with these higher level features, ITensor is very efficient.

The goal of this book is to quickly familiarize users with the 
main features of ITensor. Later chapters turn to advanced features and
customizing higher-level parts of the library.
