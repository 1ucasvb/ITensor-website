# The ITensor Book

ITensor is a library designed to lessen the complexity of tensor
calculations through an Einstein summation like interface for contracting tensors.

The early chapters of this book are designed to quickly familiarize users with the 
main features of ITensor. Later chapters deal with advanced features and
with customizing higher-level parts of the library.
