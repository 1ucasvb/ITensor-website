# The ITensor Book

ITensor is a library that reduces the complexity of tensor
calculations through an Einstein summation interface for contracting tensors.

The goal of this book is to quickly familiarize users with the 
main features of ITensor. Later chapters turn to advanced features and
customizing higher-level parts of the library.
