#ITensor Library Classes and Methods#

* [[Index|classes/index]]. Single tensor index.
* [[Index functions|classes/index_functions]] for manipulating [[Index|classes/index]] instances.
* [[ITensor|classes/itensor]]. The elementary tensor type.
* [[InitState|classes/initstate]]. Class for initializing matrix product states.

Note that class documentation may omit minor details that do not change method semantics, 
for instance describing a function signature as `f(ITensor T)` even though
its actual signature is `f(const ITensor& T)` for reasons of efficiency.
