  *Abstract*:
  Combining density functional theory with controlled numerical methods for strongly correlated systems could greatly extend the range of both. We use the density matrix renormalization group method to perform Kohn-Sham calculations with the exact density functional for a set of electronic structure models in one dimension. When correlations are strong, the total electronic density converges quickly, but the spin densities do not.

  *Abstract*:
  We introduce a class of states, called minimally entangled typical thermal states, designed to resemble a typical state of a quantum system at finite temperature with a bias towards classical (minimally entangled) properties. These states reveal in an intuitive way properties such as short-range order which may often be hidden. A finite-T density matrix renormalization group algorithm is presented which is only modestly slower than the T=0 density matrix renormalization group.

  *Abstract*:
  Among the broad spectrum of systems predicted to exhibit topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions, one-dimensional wires with strong spin-orbit coupling provide one of the most promising experimental candidates. Here we investigate the fate of the topological superconducting phase in such wires when repulsive interactions are present. Using a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, bosonization, and Hartree-Fock techniques, we demonstrate that while interactions degrade the bulk gap - consistent with recent results of Gangadharaiah et al. - they also greatly expand the parameter range over which the topological phase arises. In particular, we show that with interactions this phase can be accessed over a broader chemical potential window, thereby leading to greater immunity against disorder-induced chemical potential fluctuations in the wire. We also suggest that in certain wires strong interactions may allow Majorana fermions to be generated without requiring a magnetic field.

  *Abstract*:
  We discuss a method based on sampling minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) that can simulate finite temperature quantum systems with a computational cost comparable to the ground state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Detailed implementation of each step of the method is presented, along with efficient algorithms for working with matrix product states and matrix product operators. Furthermore, we explore how the properties of METTS can reveal characteristic order and excitations of systems and discuss why METTS form an efficient basis for sampling. Finally, we explore the extent to which the average entanglement of a METTS ensemble is minimal.
